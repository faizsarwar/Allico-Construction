                    <p class="mt-4">We ship your orders by the most commons shipping methods: via Motor Freight, UPS, and Air Freight. We reserve the right to select the most reliable carriers from our warehouse; if you require special shipping instructions, please contact RGS. We normally ship by the most economical way unless otherwise instructed.</p>

                    <p>The original Bill of Lading attached to our invoice indicated that material shipped has now become your property and is an acknowledgement by the transportation company of the receipt of the property in good condition. Safe delivery of this shipment is now the responsibility of the carrier. Please examine your shipment carefully before signing the freight bill. We will be glad to assist in tracing or recovery of lost merchandise.</p>

                    <h2 style="color:#2490d1; " ><b> Motor Freight – Damage or Shortage </b></h2>
                    <p>If any damage is noted, or if the number of pieces received does not agree with the number on the Bill of Lading, DO NOT accept the shipment without shortage or damage notated on your freight bill and signed by the carrier’s agent (driver). Failure to do so may jeopardize your recovery. If any concealed damage or shortage is discovered when unpacking, leave the material and the packing as is and notify the carrier for concealed damage or shortage inspection. Consult the carrier for necessary claim papers and disposition of damaged articles. When checking shipments, compare what was received with packing list or invoice. If there is a shortage due to our counting, YOU MUST CONTACT US WITHIN FIVE DAYS and provide us with the details.
                    <br>  <br>
                    Claims with motor freight companies must be made promptly. The freight company will not consider a claim unless presented within nine months from date of shipment. The carrier’s agent will assist you in making that claim. Claims for loss or damaged material and transportation charges, therefore, MUST NOT be deducted from the invoice, nor payment of invoices withheld awaiting adjustment of such claims, since it is the function of the carrier to guarantee safe delivery.

                    <p>We generally recommend UPS deliveries as the best method for shipping, providing certain requirements can be met. We cannot ship all materials via UPS. There is a maximum weight per package of 150 pounds, a maximum size length of 108” and a maximum size of 130” in length and girth combined. All UPS shipments require a signature, a street address and a zip code. Please do not ask us to ship UPS unless these requirements are met</p>

                    <p>If you see that a shipment is damaged upon receipt from UPS, then refuse shipment. UPS will return the shipment to us, and we will file the claim and send a new shipment to you. If after opening the package you find concealed damage, call us at once. We will instruct UPS to pick up the package and return it to us for a claim. We will reship your order. </p>
