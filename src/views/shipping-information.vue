                    <p class="mt-4">We ship your orders with the most common shipping methods: via Motor Freight, UPS and Air
freight. If you require special instructions for delivery, please contact us so we can find out
what’s best suited to meet those needs! Our normal procedure is based on whether it's an
economical way of delivering goods or not - unless otherwise instructed by our customer in
advance of receiving their order. We generally use cheapest option available but always check
before ordering as some clients may want certain services performed related specifically
around tracking numbers etc.</p>

                    <p>The shipment you just received is a highly valuable asset and we will be glad to help in any way
that we can. Please examine your package carefully before signing for it so there are no
surprises later on down the road!.</p>

                    <p>Your first priority after a shipment is to inspect the box for any damage and make sure you
match up what's on your bill with what was delivered. If there are discrepancies, don't take it
without making some calls! You might just discover hidden shortages or other problems that
could jeopardize recovery efforts in favor of sitting them out entirely by accepting shipments
containing obvious issues instead - like undeliverable due at ports where none were requested
because no one can find them when they arrive (or even before). <br> <br>
It’s important not only identify whether something has been lost during transit but also report
anything discovered immediately so as much peace-of mind possible will come along side
payment. Be sure to consult with your carrier about the necessary claim papers and disposition
of damaged articles when checking shipments. If you notice anything wrong, like an absence on
their packing list or invoice (or even if it's just not there!), contact us WITHIN FIVE DAYS so we
can resolve this for you! <br> <br>
When a shipper makes an insurance claim, the freight company will not consider it unless
submitted within nine months from date of shipment. The carrier's agent can help with this
process and ensure that all documentation is properly accounted for in order to protect their
interests as well- which means you should never have any trouble getting paid!

                    <p>Customers who need to ship their items are generally recommended for UPS delivery. There
are certain requirements that must be met in order for this service, such as meeting weight and
size restrictions per package at 150 pounds max with 108" length or 130". All orders requiringshipping will require signature upon arrival so please make sure you can deliver where

                    <p>If you receive a shipment that has been damaged upon receipt from UPS, refuse to accept it
and report the issue. We will file an insurance claim for goods returned with concealed damage
so there's no need for further action on your end unless something else happens like
discovering hidden damages when opening up packages received via standard shipping
methods such as USPS or FedEx Ground Services after they've arrived at their destination
location (which we recommend not doing). </p>
